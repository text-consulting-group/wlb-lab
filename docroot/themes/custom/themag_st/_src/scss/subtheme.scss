// This file includes the subtheme variable file and original themag.scss file.
// This is the best scenario if you'd like to change TheMAG default variables and add extra SCSS.
//
// You can also override a certain component, for example a style for the Poll component.
// In that case you have to replace @import "themag/scss/themag"; line with all components.
//
// 1. Copy the entire content from the /themes/themag/_src/themag/scss/themag.scss
// and replace this line @import "themag/scss/themag";
//
// 2. Change the include path to include the components from the base theme.
// Add "themag/scss/" before each component.
//
// Example:
//
// From @import "components/field/channel"; to @import "themag/scss/components/field/channel";
//
//
// 3. Copy the component you'd like to override from themag scss directory
// to you scss directory in a custom location, e.g. new-components directory.
// In our example we'd like to override Poll component, so we will copy _poll.scss
// from components/modules/ and past it to our new-components directory.
//
// 4. Now we have to change the include path so the poll component can be included
// from our new-component directory.
//
// From: @import "themag/scss/components/modules/poll"; to @import "new-components/poll";
//

@import "variables";
@import "themag/scss/themag";
